## SW-Jokes: Annotated listing of Star Wars jokes
This app takes a random joke from a hardcoded list, and based on the characters, species, planets, or any other fact that has a matching endpoint on the SW API, it will provide links to view the SW Api results on a much friendlier way.

Ionic View code: af9e9892

No sound or SW themed music due to copyrights.

## Nice coding features
Don' t know if really nice, but I like them...

* Cool Splash screen (kind of useless, though)
* Double lined app header (required some tweaks)
* Header with a Toogle (also required some tweaking)
* Lazy loading for pages
* SVG icons
* Lodash
* InAppBrowser for external links (solved iOS issue, due to target not optional)
* Shyriiwook translator (Chewie mode) **_NEW_**

## TODO
To resolve sometime, in the future...

* Un-hardcode the joke list
* Unit & E2E tests
* ~~Add an _"Affiliation"_ option to choose from _Jedi/Sith/or none_~~ **DONE**
* ~~Implement the real wookie mode, to apply joke translation to Shyriiwook~~ **DONE**
* Add app languages
* Use _PouchDB_ for local cache.

Had most of the TODO items in mind, but I really need to sleep.

Please report any issues. This is my first attempt for a full Ionic2 app, so bugs & improvements to be expected.
